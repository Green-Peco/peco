## 1. Project Overview
PECO is a mobile-first platform designed to empower communities, rangers, and citizen scientists to protect forests and biodiversity. Our solution enables real-time reporting of illegal activities, community engagement, environmental education, and gamified participation. Built for scalability and impact, PECO leverages modern technology to support the vision of Wangari Maathai and the goals of WMF/GBM.

## 2. Problem Statement
Illegal logging, encroachment, and lack of community engagement threaten forests and biodiversity. Existing reporting systems are fragmented, slow, and inaccessible to many stakeholders. PECO addresses these gaps by providing a unified, user-friendly platform for:
- Real-time incident reporting
- Community-driven data collection
- Environmental education and awareness
- Transparent monitoring and accountability

---

## 3. Proposed Solution
PECO is a cross-platform mobile app (React Native/Expo) with:
- **Login/Register:** Secure access for all users
- **Feed:** Reddit-style updates on reports, news, lessons, and discussions
- **Map:** Location-based reporting and viewing
- **Game/Leaderboard:** Points, badges, and achievements for engagement
- **Community:** Join, search, and interact with forest communities
- **Profile:** User stats, achievements, recent activity, and logout
- **Admin/Backend:** Node.js server for authentication, data storage, and API endpoints

**Innovation:**
- Gamified conservation (points, badges, leaderboards)
- Real-time, geo-tagged incident reporting
- Community features for collaboration
- Scalable architecture for future expansion

## 4. Technical Approach & Prototype
- **Frontend:** React Native (Expo Router), organized in `frontend/mobile-peco`
- **Backend:** Node.js server (`backend/serve.js`)
- **APIs:** RESTful endpoints for authentication, reports, communities, and user data
- **Data Flow:**
  - User logs in/registers
  - Submits reports (with location, photo, description)
  - Data sent to backend, stored, and displayed in feed/map
  - Community and gamification features update in real time
- **Core Features:**
  - Clean, modern UI (green accent, card layouts)
  - Demo credentials for easy testing
  - Modular, maintainable codebase
- **Tools & Datasets:**
  - Expo, React Native, Node.js, Express
  - (Optional) GIS layers, satellite data, external APIs

---

## 5. Impact & Feasibility
- **Environmental Impact:**
  - Faster, more transparent reporting of illegal activities
  - Increased community engagement and education
  - Data-driven decision making for forest management
- **Feasibility:**
  - Mobile-first, low barrier to entry
  - Scalable across counties, forest stations, and communities
  - Designed for integration with WMF/GBM workflows
  - Open-source, extensible architecture

---

## 6. Scalability & Sustainability
- Modular design for easy feature addition
- Can integrate with future tools, datasets, and APIs
- Long-term maintainability with clear documentation
- Flexible for different forest contexts and user groups
