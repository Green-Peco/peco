            "content": "When choosing trees for your local environment, it's crucial to understand the difference between native and exotic species. Native trees are those that have evolved in a particular region over thousands of years. They are well-adapted to the local climate, soil, and wildlife. Exotic trees, on the other hand, are introduced from other regions. While some exotics can be beneficial, many can become invasive, out-competing native species for resources and disrupting the local ecosystem."
